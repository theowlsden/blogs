Most of the time, people ask: What would your dream job look like? Or, what is the ideal company you would like to work at?

One thing I rarely hear people asking is this: 

Imagine an ideal world that you didn't have to worry about money, thus didn't have to work. What would be the dream project you'd be working on as a developer?

As a developer, maybe there is this one side project that you always wanted to work on, but never got that far. What is that project, and why is it important to you?
