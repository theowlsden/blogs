As I was reading @technoglot's [recap of one of the sessions of the last hashnode bootcamp](https://dev.to/technoglot/boost-your-online-presence-with-a-strong-personal-brand-4j8e) I started wondering, What is the best social platform for software engineers to engage with each other?

Which is the platform where developers, designers and everyone in tech have the floor to share their projects and views on specific topics? (Besides dev.to of course)

I personally use instagram on a daily basis, and to be honest I don't think it is the ideal for sharing projects or having a discussion. It's more suitable to share short informative posts in my opinion. Twitter is where I see most developers, but I find its UI too cluttered and that makes it difficult to follow a thread. (Mind you, I post about my hobby's nothing technology specific.)

What are your views on the different social media out there for developers? Which ones do you personally use and enjoy?
